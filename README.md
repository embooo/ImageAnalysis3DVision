# TP-AnalyseImage

On Windows, execute buildVS2019.bat to generate the project files for Visual Studio 2019 with premake.
You can modify this script to generate for another IDE : https://premake.github.io/docs/Using-Premake/

Once built, the binary is located in the bin folder located at the root of the archive.
To execute, either use a command prompt and specify a file e.g tp1.exe <image.format> or drag and drop an image file into the executable.

The different image operations are under the ImOp namespace in TP1.cpp.
